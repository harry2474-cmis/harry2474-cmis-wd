			<h3> 
				Lists and Links
			</h3>
			<p>
					In this assignment, I have added many useful websites for html in an unodered list. Lastly, I added the steps how to create a new webpage on the production server.
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.
					</li>
					<li>
						Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"
					</li>
					<li>
						In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.
					</li>
					<li>
						Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.	
					</li>
					<li>
						In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index page.
					</li>
					<li>
						In your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links to the nav section with a link to "listsandlinks".
					</li>
					<li>
						In your old index.html, add an article with a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements. 

					</li>
					<li>
						Turn in your work.
					</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>
				Tables
			</h3>
					<p>
						In this assignment, I created three tables and they include simple grid, calendar , class schedule.
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Create a new folder in your repository called "tables"
							</li>
							<li>
								In the "tables" folder, create a new file called from your template "index.html"
							</li>
							<li>
								Be sure to use thead, tbody, and tfoot elements in your tables.
							</li>
							<li>
								Add html code to recreate the webpage below.
								<ul>
									<li>
										second table will require the use of the colspan attribute.
									</li>
									<li>
										third table will require the use of the rowspan attribute.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								In your repository index.html file, add an article with a heading, paragraph description and this list of requirements. Also add a link to the tables/index.html file. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Add a link from lists and links to this assignment as well.
							</li>
							<li>
								Validate your code.
							</li>
							<li>
								Turn it in.
							</li>
						</ul>
